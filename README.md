# Match_Transformation_Blender
Introduce match transformation feature (inspired by the similar feature in Maya) in Blender
There is one main difference of matching transformation between Maya and Blender. 
Instead of selecting parent as the first target and children as the last target in Maya, 
Blender requires user to select the children as the first target(s), the parent as the last target.
